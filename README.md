Please note that due to the nature of emulators, their location is automatically 
at GooglePlex in California. You need to change the location manually by going to
the extended controls of the emulator and change it to wherever you would like it to be.
As a result of this, when you allow live location for the first time, the emulator
does not find the current location; however, this issue is fixed if you close and reopen the
app because that location will be stored as "last known location."
